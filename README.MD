# Official TeaSpeak Client issue tracker

Welcome here! This repository is created with two reasons:  
1. People can bring their own ideas and follow their implementation  
2. People can see TeaSpeak's Client progress and avoid creating repetitive issues all the time.  
  
To **report an issue**, then find and push the **New Issue** button, fill all the fields you see in a template, and then click the **Submit new issue** button.  
  
You can also ask questions here, if you have any.
